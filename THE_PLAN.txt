Things I think we should use.

-React Js for frontend UI
	- With either Material-UI or Semantic-UI.
		- Both are great, but if we use Material-UI
		  It will look like we used material. 
		  Semantic-UI is a little easier to customize,
		  but either is fine with me.
		  
-Redux for state management
	- This may not get large enough to need a global state manager
	  but it's probably just good practice.
		  
-Node Js for backend and logic.
	- NPM not Yarn (This is just personal preference)
	  I am familiar with NPM for package management.
	  The only thing I've used yarn with has had issues.
	 
-MongoDB for that sweet database action
	- Honestly, we could just use Firebase for 
	  a backend if we wanted to. I'm cool with 
	  either.
